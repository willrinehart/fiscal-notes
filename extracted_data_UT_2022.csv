Enactment of this legislation could forgo revenue to the state sales tax in an indeterminant amount but
equal to 20% of the incremental state sales tax generated within the boundaries of housing and transit
reinvestment zones. This could impact both the General Fund and sales tax earmarks. Ten percent
of the increment would be transferred to the Transit Transportation Investment Fund while the other
10 percent would be transferred to the municipality or public transit county proposing the zone. For
each $100,000 in incremental sales tax, $15,000 would be transferred away from the General Fund
and $5,000 away from sales tax earmarks. Enactment of this legislation could also generate $100,000
annually in dedicated credits for the Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity.","FY 2022

Enactment of this legislation expands the allowable uses of the State Store Land Acquisition and
Building Construction Fund to include construction and renovation of state liquor stores but does
not increase funding or authorize any store construction. Enactment of this legislation could cost the
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control approximately $215,600 ongoing beginning in FY 2024
from the Liquor Control Fund for new or additional operations and maintenance costs for liquor stores
in Park City, St. George, Downtown and Foothill (spending from the Liquor Control Fund impacts year-
end transfers to the General Fund). Enactment authorizes the State Building Ownership Authority to
issue revenue bonds of up to $43,119,600 (plus direct issue costs) for construction of these liquor
stores; and it authorizes the Board of Higher Education to issue revenue bonds up to $811.8 million
(plus direct issue costs) for construction projects at the University of Utah ($718.3 million), Utah State
University ($7.0 million), Dixie State University (Utah Tech University) ($62.5 million), Utah Valley
University ($12.0 million), and Southern Utah University ($12.0 million). Assuming equal annual
payments, interest rates of about 2.7 percent, and bond maturities of 20 years for the liquor store
projects, enactment could cost about $1.1 million annually for 20 years beginning in FY 2023 from the
Liquor Control Fund for principal and interest debt payments; and assuming equal annual payments,
interest rates of about 2.6 percent, and bond maturity of 15 years for the Utah State University bond,
bond maturities of 20 years for Utah Valley University and University of Utah Applied Sciences
Building, Mental Health Facility, Indoor Football Practice Facility, and Epicenter and 30 years for
the Southern Utah University bonds, enactment could cost about $50.6 million annually for 20 years
beginning in FY 2023 and about $6.3 million thereafter for 10 years from various financing sources for
principal and interest debt payments. However, actual debt service payments for any of these bonds
would depend on the timing and terms of bond issuances.

Enactment of this legislation could increase new growth revenues from the 10 percent decrease in
effective property tax differential given to the Authority. An immediate reduction of SLC's incremental
values will increase their adjusted values to calculate the tax rate. Assuming this is not counted
as reappraisal, the increase in the value difference from 2023 to 2022 will be counted as new
growth. This amount represents approximately $100,000 in additional new growth revenue that will
become part of the revenue target for the certified tax rate in future years. As the percentage of
property tax differential continues decrease over time, this will yield smaller increases to new growth
revenues proportionate to the decrease in the property tax differential transferred to the Authority,
increase in values and changes to the tax rate through to 2047. Additionally, for every business
recruitment incentive approved for $1.0 billion in capital expenditure, local governments could forego
approximately $2.6 million in property tax revenue.

Enactment of this legislation expands the allowable uses of the State Store Land Acquisition and

increase funding or authorize any store construction. The bill also authorizes the Board of Higher
Education to issue revenue bonds up to $811.8 million (plus direct issue costs) for construction
projects at the University of Utah ($718.3 million), Utah State University ($7.0 million), Dixie State
University (Utah Tech University) ($62.5 million), Utah Valley University ($12.0 million), and Southern
Utah University ($12.0 million). Assuming equal annual payments, interest rates of about 2.6 percent,
and bond maturity of 15 years for the Utah State University bond, bond maturities of 20 years for
Utah Valley University and University of Utah Applied Sciences Building, Mental Health Facility,
Indoor Football Practice Facility, and Epicenter and 30 years for the Southern Utah University bonds,
enactment could cost about $50.6 million annually for 20 years beginning in FY 2023 and about $6.3
million thereafter for 10 years from various financing sources for principal and interest debt payments.
However, actual debt service payments for any of these bonds would depend on the timing and terms
of bond issuances.

For cases that would otherwise be initially processed as death penalty cases but would now

save the Courts about $19,200 ongoing from the General Fund, beginning in FY 2025 at the earliest
from reduced legal processing costs and cost $1,200 one-time in FY 2022 for programming changes
which they can absorb. This bill could also have the following known secondary General Fund impacts:
1. Attorney General - This could save the Attorney General about $44,500 each year in appeals
costs for those offenders that would otherwise be awaiting a final determination on their sentence for
each applicable case. Conversely, this could cost the Attorney General about $1,084,900 ongoing
in legal challenges for those currently sentenced but presumably do not qualify for the reduced
sentence; 2. Corrections - Beginning in FY 2043, this could cost the Department of Corrections on
average about $36,200 each year in incarceration costs. This may also save the Department about
$165,000 one-time in preparation and execution costs for each applicable case; 3. Department of
Administrative Services - This may save $10,800 in legal defense each year from the Post Conviction
Indigent Defense Fund in applicable cases; 4. Board of Pardon and Parole - This may save the Board
$22,400 one-time in hearing and research costs for each applicable case; 5. Department of Public
Safety - This may save the Department of Public Safety $7,500 one-time for evidence review costs
for each applicable case; and 6. Courts - This could cost the Courts unknown amount in additional
case processing for legal challenges from offenders who don't qualify for a penalty reduction under the

Enactment of this legislation could have a fiscal impact for Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to
collect and submit a sample from consumable taps in their facilities to a Certified Laboratory for lead
testing. The expense of testing would be paid by the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).
It is estimated that there are 45,262 consumable taps subject to testing, and 11% of those taps
may require action. The average cost for lead remediation is $281. To the extent that consumable
taps are found to be above the action level of 5 parts-per-billion, LEAs could incur expenses of up
to $1,399,000 for remediation actions. Subject to availability of funding from previously authorized
Federal grants, these expenses may be reimbursable through DEQ. This figure could be reduced if
taps have been tested for lead since January 1st, 2016.","UCA 36-12-13(2)(c)
Enactment of this legislation could result in a fiscal impact for private schools (who would be required)
and childcare centers (who would have the option) to collect and submit a sample from consumable

would not be required to pay for lead testing, however Private Schools would be financially responsible
for remediation of taps that test above the action level of 5 parts-per-billion and are required to report
remedial actions to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). It is estimated that there are
8,100 in Private Schools and Childcare Centers subject to testing, and that 11% of those taps may
require remedial actions. The average cost for lead remediation is $281, resulting in a total possible
cost to all private schools and childcare centers in the state of $250,400 (which may be reimbursable
through DEQ, subject to the availability of previously authorized Federal grants). This figure could be
reduced if consumable taps have been tested for lead since January 1st, 2016.","UCA 36-12-13(2)(d)

Enactment of this legislation could reduce property tax revenue to local governments indefinitely due
to a decline in total centrally assessed value below the benchmark necessary for local governments
to generate revenue from new growth. Enactment of this legislation could also increase costs for local
governments that would take on the responsibility to appraise telecommunications companies' real
property; this could result in a cost to counties of approximately $40,000 per appraisal and $1,000
per appeal. The aggregate cost is unknown. Finally, enactment of this legislation could increase costs
for the Multicounty Appraisal Trust for appraising telecommunication companies' personal property
by approximately $1 million annually. Additionally, changes to the formula for calculating an energy
supplier's fee in lieu of property tax may affect the exemption of a project entity to the fee in lieu for
the capacity, service, or other benefit from the facility that is resold (including by an exempt entity) to
a non-exempt entity. Currently 14% of project entity value is exempt from the fee in lieu on this basis.
If this entire percentage is no longer exempt, it may represent a revenue increase of up to $5.8 million
statewide.

Enactment of this legislation could result in a tax shift, wherein telecommunications companies could
have reduced property tax burdens and all other filers could have increased property tax burdens.
The aggregate impact is estimated to be a shift of approximately $19 million annually. Additionally,
changes to the formula for calculating an energy supplier's fee in lieu of property tax may affect the
exemption of a project entity to the fee in lieu for the capacity, service, or other benefit from the facility
that is resold (including by an exempt entity) to a non-exempt entity. Currently 14% of project entity

Enactment of this legislation expands the allowable uses of the State Store Land Acquisition and

not increase funding or authorize any store construction. Enactment of this legislation could cost the
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control approximately $78,300 ongoing beginning in FY 2024 from
the Liquor Control Fund for new or additional operations and maintenance costs for liquor stores in
Park City and St. George (spending from the Liquor Control Fund impacts year-end transfers to the
General Fund). Enactment authorizes the State Building Ownership Authority to issue revenue bonds
of up to $15,669,600 (plus direct issue costs) for construction of these liquor stores; and it authorizes
the Board of Higher Education to issue revenue bonds up to $811.8 million (plus direct issue costs)
for construction projects at the University of Utah ($718.3 million), Utah State University ($7.0 million),
Dixie State University (Utah Tech University) ($62.5 million), Utah Valley University ($12.0 million),
and Southern Utah University ($12.0 million). Assuming equal annual payments, interest rates of
about 2.7 percent, and bond maturities of 20 years for the liquor store projects, enactment could
cost about $1.1 million annually for 20 years beginning in FY 2023 from the Liquor Control Fund for
principal and interest debt payments; and assuming equal annual payments, interest rates of about 2.6
percent, and bond maturity of 15 years for the Utah State University bond, bond maturities of 20 years
for Utah Valley University and University of Utah Applied Sciences Building, Mental Health Facility,
Indoor Football Practice Facility, and Epicenter and 30 years for the Southern Utah University bonds,
enactment could cost about $50.6 million annually for 20 years beginning in FY 2023 and about $6.3

Enactment of this bill increases the number of Weighted Pupil Units (WPUs) for the Special Education
Add-on program in the Minimum School Program by 1,607 WPUs over the 89,232 WPUs previously
estimated for FY 2023. At the initial FY 2023 WPU Value of $3,908 this increase in the number of
WPUs may cost the State Board of Education $4,037,000 ongoing and $2,243,200 one-time from the
Uniform School Fund beginning in FY 2023. Subsequent increases in the WPU Value for FY 2023
will increase this estimate. Bill provisions reduce the WPU weighting applied to student growth over
the next three fiscal years. The one-time amount mentioned above represents the cost differential
between the WPU weighting for FY 2023 at 1.35 and the final weight of 1.0 in FY 2025. Balances in
the Minimum School Program - Basic School Program can absorb this differential in FY 2023. In FY
2024 and FY 2025, the differential between the prior year weighting and the new year weighting will be
netted in the cost of student enrollment growth.

This bill appropriates $47,735,300 ongoing and ($24,735,500) one-time from the Uniform School
Fund to Minimum School Program - Early Intervention beginning in FY 2023. This bill also decreases
appropriations from the Uniform School Fund to Minimum School Program - Early Intervention by
($12,000,000) one-time in FY 2024. Enactment of this legislation increases the Weighted Pupil Unit
(WPU) weighting for Kindergarten from 0.55 to 1.0 in district schools and 0.9 in charter schools
beginning in FY 2025 to implement full-day kindergarten options at all Local Education Agencies
(LEAs). At the initial FY 2023 WPU Value of $3,908 and with an estimated participation rate of
95% in full day kindergarten, this increase in the weighting could cost the State Board of Education
approximately $72,190,300 ongoing from the Uniform School Fund beginning in FY 2025. Subsequent
changes in student enrollment and increases in the WPU Value for FY 2023, 2024, and 2025 will
change this estimate. In addition, enactment of this legislation repeals the Enhanced Kindergarten
Early Intervention Program beginning in FY 2025. Cost savings of $24,455,000 ongoing from the
repeal of the Early Intervention Program are factored into the final ongoing fiscal impact from this bill.

Enactment of this legislation could forgo revenue to the state sales tax in an indeterminant amount but

reinvestment zones. This could impact both the General Fund and sales tax earmarks. Ten percent
of the increment would be transferred to the Transit Transportation Investment Fund while the other
10 percent would be transferred to the municipality or public transit county proposing the zone. For
each $100,000 in incremental sales tax, $15,000 would be transferred away from the General Fund

This bill appropriates $47,735,300 ongoing and ($24,735,500) one-time from the Uniform School
Fund to Minimum School Program - Early Intervention beginning in FY 2023. Enactment of this
legislation increases the Weighted Pupil Unit (WPU) weighting for Kindergarten from 0.55 to 1.0 in
district schools and 0.9 in charter schools beginning in FY 2025 to implement full-day kindergarten
options at all Local Education Agencies (LEAs). At the initial FY 2023 WPU Value of $3,908 and with
an estimated participation rate of 95% in full day kindergarten, this increase in the weighting could
cost the State Board of Education approximately $72,190,300 ongoing from the Uniform School Fund
beginning in FY 2025. Subsequent changes in student enrollment and increases in the WPU Value for
FY 2023, 2024, and 2025 will change this estimate. In addition, enactment of this legislation repeals
the Enhanced Kindergarten Early Intervention Program beginning in FY 2025. Cost savings from the
repeal of the Early Intervention Program are factored into the final cost estimate of expanding the full

to a decline in total centrally assessed value below the benchmark necessary for local governments
to generate revenue from new growth. Enactment of this legislation could also increase costs for local
governments that would take on the responsibility to appraise telecommunications companies' real
property; this could result in a cost to counties of approximately $40,000 per appraisal and $1,000 per
appeal. The aggregate cost is unknown. Finally, enactment of this legislation could increase costs for
the Multicounty Appraisal Trust for appraising telecommunication companies' personal property by
approximately $1 million annually.","UCA 36-12-13(2)(c)

Enactment of this legislation could increase new growth revenues from the 10 percent decrease in
effective property tax differential given to the Authority. An immediate reduction of SLC's incremental
values will increase their adjusted values to calculate the tax rate. Assuming this is not counted
as reappraisal, the increase in the value difference from 2023 to 2022 will be counted as new
growth. This amount represents approximately $100,000 in additional new growth revenue that will
become part of the revenue target for the certified tax rate in future years. As the percentage of
property tax differential continues decrease over time, this will yield smaller increases to new growth
revenues proportionate to the decrease in the property tax differential transferred to the Authority,
increase in values and changes to the tax rate through to 2047. Additionally, for every business
recruitment incentive approved for $1.0 billion in capital expenditure, local governments could forego
approximately $2.6 million in property tax revenue.

Courts a total of about $9,025,000 ongoing from the General Fund beginning FY 2023. This assumes
(1) about 16 district court judgeships to process about 200 cases/judgeship at a cost of $475,000/

$78,300 ongoing beginning in FY 2024 from the Liquor Control Fund for new or additional operations
and maintenance costs for liquor stores in Park City and St. George (spending from the Liquor
Control Fund impacts year-end transfers to the General Fund). Enactment authorizes the State
Building Ownership Authority to issue revenue bonds of up to $15,669,600 (plus direct issue costs) for
construction of these liquor stores; and it authorizes the Board of Higher Education to issue revenue
bonds of up to $749.8 million (plus direct issue costs) for construction projects at the University of
Utah ($656.3 million), Utah State University ($7.0 million), Dixie State University ($62.5 million),
Utah Valley University ($12.0 million) and Southern Utah University ($12.0 million). Assuming equal
annual payments, interest rates of about 2.7 percent, and bond maturities of 20 years for the liquor
store projects, enactment could cost about $1.1 million annually for 20 years beginning in FY 2023
from the Liquor Control Fund for principal and interest debt payments; and assuming equal annual
payments, interest rates of about 2.7 percent, and bond maturity of 15 years for Utah State University
bond, bond maturities of 20 years Utah Valley University and University of Utah Applied Sciences
Building, Mental Health Facility and Epicenter and 30 years for the Southern Utah University bonds,
enactment could cost about $46.7 million annually for 20 years beginning in FY 2023 and about $6.3
million thereafter for 10 years from various financing sources for principal and interest debt payments.
However, actual debt service payments for any of these bonds would depend on the timing and terms
of bond issuances.

beginning July 1, 2023. In total, this is estimated to save taxpayers approximately $10.1 million in
taxes in FY 2024 and $11.3 million in FY 2025. Changing the repeal date on the Unified Statewide 911

UCA 36-12-13(2)(c)
Enactment of this legislation could reduce property tax revenue to local governments indefinitely due
to a decline in total centrally assessed value below the benchmark necessary for local governments
to generate revenue from new growth. Enactment of this legislation could also increase costs for
local governments that would take on the responsibility to appraise telecommunications companies'
real property; this could result in a cost to counties of approximately $40,000 per appraisal and
$1,000 per appeal. The aggregate cost is unknown. Enactment of this legislation could also increase
costs for the Multicounty Appraisal Trust for appraising telecommunication companies' personal
property by approximately $1 million annually. The tax rate increase of the multicounty assessing and
collecting levy could increase revenue to the Property Tax Valuation Fund by approximately $173,700
ongoing beginning in FY2023 and could also increase revenue to the Multicounty Appraisal Trust
by approximately $791,400 ongoing. Additionally, changes to the formula for calculating an energy
supplier's fee in lieu of property tax may affect the exemption of a project entity to the fee in lieu for
the capacity, service, or other benefit from the facility that is resold (including by an exempt entity) to
a non-exempt entity. Currently 14% of project entity value is exempt from the fee in lieu on this basis.
If this entire percentage is no longer exempt, it may represent a revenue increase of up to $5.8 million
statewide.","UCA 36-12-13(2)(c)
Enactment of this legislation could result in a tax shift, wherein telecommunications companies could
have reduced property tax burdens and all other filers could have increased property tax burdens.
The aggregate impact is estimated to be a shift of approximately $19 million annually. Additionally,
changes to the multicounty levy will increase property taxes statewide by approximately $965,100
ongoing. For a $350,000 residence, this may represent a $0.58 increase in property tax liability. For a
$1 million business, this may represent a $3.00 increase in property tax liability. Additionally, changes
to the formula for calculating an energy supplier's fee in lieu of property tax may affect the exemption
of a project entity to the fee in lieu for the capacity, service, or other benefit from the facility that is

consolidates two Necessarily Existent Small Schools. For each school district that opts to consolidate
schools, the number of WPUs generated by the combined school may increase by approximately 35

state would be $136,800 ongoing. This amount may vary depending on the schools consolidated, the
number of WPUs calculated, and the WPU Value at the time of implementation. Enactment of this

to a decline in total centrally assessed value below the benchmark necessary for local governments
to generate revenue from new growth. Enactment of this legislation could also increase costs for local
governments that would take on the responsibility to appraise telecommunications companies' real

appeal. The aggregate cost is unknown. Finally, enactment of this legislation could increase costs for
the Multicounty Appraisal Trust for appraising telecommunication companies' personal property by
approximately $1 million annually.","UCA 36-12-13(2)(c)

Enactment of this legislation increases the Weighted Pupil Unit (WPU) weighting for Kindergarten
from 0.55 to 1.0 in district schools and 0.9 in charter schools beginning in FY 2025 to implement full-
day kindergarten options at all Local Education Agencies (LEAs). At the initial FY 2023 WPU Value
of $3,908 and with an estimated participation rate of 95% in full day kindergarten, this increase in
the weighting could cost the State Board of Education approximately $72,190,300 ongoing from
the Uniform School Fund beginning in FY 2025. Subsequent increases in the WPU Value for FY
2023, 2024, and 2025 will increase this estimate. In addition, enactment of this legislation repeals
the Enhanced Kindergarten Early Intervention Program beginning in FY 2025 at a current cost of
$24,455,000. Factoring in the savings from this program elimination brings the estimated cost to
$47,735,300.

Enactment of this bill increases the number of Weighted Pupil Units (WPUs) for the Special Education
Add-on program in the Minimum School Program by 1,607 WPUs over the 89,232 WPUs previously
estimated for FY 2023. At the initial FY 2023 WPU Value of $3,908 this increase in the number of
WPUs may cost the State Board of Education $4,037,000 ongoing and $2,243,200 one-time from the
Uniform School Fund beginning in FY 2023. Subsequent increases in the WPU Value for FY 2023
will increase this estimate. Bill provisions reduce the WPU weighting applied to student growth over
the next three fiscal years. The one-time amount mentioned above represents the cost differential
between the WPU weighting for FY 2023 at 1.35 and the final weight of 1.0 in FY 2025. Balances in
the Minimum School Program - Basic School Program can absorb this differential in FY 2023. In FY
2024 and FY 2025, the differential between the prior year weighting and the new year weighting will be
netted in the cost of student enrollment growth.
